We will explore how a comprehensive cohesive strategy may assist in prevention efforts in Georgia and opportunities to further collaborate and synergize efforts for underage alcohol and underage tobacco use prevention. We will also explore how compliance and enforcement data might be used to the benefit of all stakeholders. This workshop will generate ideas, strategic initiatives and resources not previously identified.",

      "description": "Mass media campaigns are widely used to expose high proportions of large populations to messages through routine uses of existing media, such as television, radio, and newspapers. Exposure to such messages is, therefore, generally passive. Such campaigns are frequently competing with factors, such as pervasive product marketing, powerful social norms, and behaviours driven by addiction or habit. In this Review we discuss the outcomes of mass media campaigns in the context of various health-risk behaviours (eg, use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, heart disease risk factors, sex-related behaviours, road safety, cancer screening and prevention, child survival, and organ or blood donation).",

      "description": "In February 2020 the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes, spread from China to the U.S. and other countries, severely restricting national and international travel. By March 11th the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. As a result of these developments, many organizations, agencies, and institutions restricted travel as well, and public health authorities recommended curtailing large-scale gatherings. Online and distance-based solutions were proposed and adopted, and in many places remote work is becoming the new norm. Managing the expectations and demands of this new workplace involves understanding and addressing unforeseen challenges and finding new and effective solutions; and adapting to this changing economic and social reality means that developing and honing remote work strategies will be increasingly essential.",

      "description": "Overdose deaths from heroin and prescription opioids are a major public health problem that has reached epidemic proportions in the United States in recent years. Since 1999 the number of overdose deaths involving opioids quadrupled (CDC, 2016). From 2000 to 2015 more than half a million people died from drug overdoses, with more than six out of ten involving an opioid (Rudd et al., 2016). Ninety-one Americans die every day from an opioid overdose (CDC, 2017). In Australia, overdose has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among heroin injectors (Roxburgh &, Degenhardt, 2008). To address these crises, numerous public health researchers have developed and studied various strategies for prevention, intervention, and treatment, offering analysis of the conditions of the problem as well as potentially successful approaches.",

      "description": "Awareness raising (also called consciousness raising) is the process of groups of people aiming to call the attention of the larger population to specific causes or conditions, such as diseases, conflicts, movements, or political parties. It has been defined as \u201ca constructive and potentially catalytic force that ultimately leads to a positive change in actions and behaviours\u201d (Sayers, 2006, p. 20) It can be considered a form of activism, often being a first step in which advocacy groups engage (Freedman, 2014). For instance, in the context of 1970\u2019s feminism, consciousness raising referred to the idea of discussing the everyday effects of sexism, racism, or classism within groups of individuals sharing these experiences (Chicago WLU, 1971).",

These papers offer a valuable introduction to the relationship between substance abuse prevention and behavioral health. The product of a collaborative effort by some of the top minds in the field, each paper can also serve as a source of additional information for direct service providers, administrators, and others. In addition to presenting them individually, a synthesis of common themes across these papers is provided.

Most of the studies included in this review found that greater outlet density is associated with increased alcohol consumption and related harms, including medical harms, injury, crime, and violence.",
